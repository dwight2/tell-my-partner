# tell-my-partner
*Very* simple Alexa Skill based on the 'Space Geek' tutorial, which should be on GitHub (I followed https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx3DVGG0K0TPUGQ/New-Alexa-Skills-Kit-Template:-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Build-a-Fact-Skill ).

At time of writing is published on Amazon as 'Tell My Partner' and was really just a quick test of this Alexa thing and AWS out of curiosity.
